Metis data science bootcamp has been as rigorous and challenging as I thought it would be. I've already had some <i>Aha!</i> moments, which I always cherish. You know, like when you're getting slightly frustrated as the teacher starts down a path that  as the teacher  a problem's elusive solution suddenly comes into rigid focus and the sky seems to open up.

Time is flying, though, and I wish I could take more time to work on all the projects, challenges, presentations,  Week 3 starts tomorrow and time is flying! The first two weeks were challenging
I'm not sure whether I'm about to give up, give in, or give out. 
Or maybe I should swallow my pride and give it <it>up</i> -- for the fantastic instructors, staff, teaching assistants, my classmates, and myself. This is hard work

Last week was my first week at Metis Data Science Bootcamp 


An hour before they burst above the East River, I was losing my mind on a subway platform. Bronx-bound ![]("/images/NYCS-bull-trans-7.svg.png")  trains were coming and going, my friends were supposed to meet me here 20 minutes ago and they're nowhere. Here I am in this <i>shmutsik</i> <img src="/images/small_grand_central_sign.jpg" height=50 width=300"> station, and we're gonna miss the fireworks.

Finally i get a text:
"We're here - where are you?"  
"Right here," I answered.  
"We don't see you."  
I peered down the platform. <img src="/images/Grand_Central_Flushing_station.jpg">

<h3>"Where are you?!"</h3>
This went on for 15 minutes. I walked to the other end of the platform and back again. No sight of them. People were starting to stream onto the platform, making it harder for me to trust my perception of their NOT BEING THERE. Fifteen more minutes, several texts, a couple of cut calls between us, and I was fed up. They’re not pranksters; if they say they’re here on the platform, they must be. Eventually we all must have gotten fed up because we ended up meeting at our destination in LIC. But what in the world had happened? Was I bonkers? Were they? Nope, neither. But the signage could have been a little better. 

It was an honest mistake, but one I should have been alert to given what I’d been working on a few days earlier at Metis Data Science Bootcamp. There was a point where our team didn’t yet realize that the variable holding the station name in the MTA Turnstile dataset was similarly confusing.

Like when my friends and I got our wires crossed and ended up waiting for each other at the 42nd St. station, the only problem being that unbeknownst to us, we were two stations apart and seemingly every 7 station in Manhattan seem to have "42nd St" in its name.
