An hour before they burst above the East River, I was losing my mind on a subway platform. Bronx-bound ![]("/images/NYCS-bull-trans-7.svg.png")  trains were coming and going, my friends were supposed to meet me here 20 minutes ago and they're nowhere. Here I am in this <i>shmutsik</i> <img src="/images/small_grand_central_sign.jpg" height=50 width=300"> station, and we're gonna miss the fireworks.

Finally i get a text:
"We're here - where are you?"  
"Right here," I answered.  
"We don't see you."  
I peered down the platform. <img src="/images/Grand_Central_Flushing_station.jpg">





<h3>"Where are you?!"</h3>
This went on for 15 minutes. I walked to the other end of the platform and back again. No sight of them. People were starting to stream onto the platform, making it harder for me to trust my perception of their NOT BEING THERE. Fifteen more minutes, several texts, a couple of cut calls between us, and I was fed up. They’re not pranksters; if they say they’re here on the platform, they must be. Eventually we all must have gotten fed up because we ended up meeting at our destination in LIC. But what in the world had happened? Was I bonkers? Were they? Nope, neither. But the signage could have been a little better. 

It was an honest mistake, but one I should have been alert to given what I’d been working on a few days earlier at Metis Data Science Bootcamp. There was a point where our team didn’t yet realize that the variable holding the station name in the MTA Turnstile dataset was similarly confusing.
