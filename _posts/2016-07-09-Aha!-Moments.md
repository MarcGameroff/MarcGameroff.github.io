So far, [Metis data science bootcamp](http://www.thisismetis.com/data-science)'s been as rigorous and satisfying as I thought it would be. We're two weeks in and I've already enjoyed several <i>Aha!</i> moments. You know, like when you're sitting with your [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) partner, staring at the laptop screen like that's gonna explain how the [list comprehension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_comprehension) you cooked up together actually worked, and you're glad you're getting more [Pythonic](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25011078/what-does-pythonic-mean) by the minute, but how is that comprehension working under the hood and enabling you to save 5 lines of code, and then suddenly the logic comes into rigid focus and you understand! Mind kinda blown.

Apparently I'm not alone:

Sometimes a discovery plays <b>hide and seek</b>. Like in that dream where you've finally cracked the kidnappers' location and it flashes on your screen for a second and all you have to do is hit <Enter> to transmit it to the SWAT commander and PFFT! your screen flickers and dies and your machine spontaneously combusts. Whoops. Let's hope your third grade teacher was right and you really <i>do</i> have a photographic memory after all. If not, be ready to repent:

Last week, a game of hide and seek really did play out on the Manhattan side of the Flushing !["7"](/images/NYCS-bull-trans-7.svg.png){: .smallpic1} line. I was meeting up with some friends in the Grand Central-42nd St. station to ride out to Long Island City to see the Fourth of July fireworks from a friend's envy-enducing 15th floor balcony. Ten minutes after our scheduled meetup time, the text rally began:  
"Where are you?"  
"I'm at the front end of the platform."  
"Us too. We don't see you."  
"I'm right here."  
"Where???"  
"RIGHT HERE!!"  

Fifteen minutes later, we finally figured it out. We'd gotten our wires crossed. They were waiting for me at the <i>Times Square</i>-42nd St. station while I was waiting for them at the <i>Grand Central</i>-42nd St. station.

Absurd, given that a week before at Metis, our project team was lamenting the annoying ambiguity of subway station names in some of the data files. Only by assigning latitude/longitude values and archaic acronyms could we reliably distinguish these 3 stations:

![](/images/ind_42nd_in_data.png)
![](/images/times_sq_in_data.png)

Learn everything you can from your data. Starting with the very simple lesson that its ambiguity might be less an artifact than a reflection of real-world ambiguity. I have no confidence that there isn't another "42nd St." station in my future that won't match up with someone else's "42nd St." station, when the price for error could be a SWAT team's failure to save those .

Anyhow, we made it to the fireworks with plenty of time to spare, and they were as dazzling and explosive as my next <i>Aha!</i> moment will likely be.
