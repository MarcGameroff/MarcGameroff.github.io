So far, Metis data science bootcamp has been as rigorous and challenging as I thought it would be. We're two weeks in and I've already had some happifying <i>Aha!</i> moments. You know, like when you're sitting with your pair programming partner, staring dumbly at the laptop screen as if that's gonna explain why the list comprehension you cooked up actually worked, and you're glad that you made your code more Pythonic and all but how in the world is that beautiful Python comprehension working under the hood and enabling you to save 5 lines of code and then suddenly the logic and mechanism come into rigid focus in your mind and you've finally understood <b>why</b>! It can be breathtaking. 

I am not alone:

And dig these <b>grateful</b> folks:

right through the laptop screen as if the your  working on a problem and the solution's elusive -- you're invested in it, and right before your brain gives out from the strain of perplexity, the answer  comes into rigid focus and you're as pleased and rewarded as a _______.  




you're getting slightly frustrated as the teacher starts down a path that  as the teacher  a problem's elusive solution suddenly comes into rigid focus and the sky seems to open up.

[garden path sentence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_path_sentence) and you have to recalibrate your attention or 

Time is flying, though, and I wish I could take more time to work on all the projects, challenges, presentations,  Week 3 starts tomorrow and time is flying! The first two weeks were challenging
I'm not sure whether I'm about to give up, give in, or give out. 
Or maybe I should swallow my pride and give it <it>up</i> -- for the fantastic instructors, staff, teaching assistants, my classmates, and myself. This is hard work 




An hour before they burst above the East River, I was losing my mind on a subway platform. Bronx-bound ![]("/images/NYCS-bull-trans-7.svg.png")  trains were coming and going, my friends were supposed to meet me here 20 minutes ago and they're nowhere. Here I am in this <i>shmutsik</i> <station, and we're gonna miss the fireworks. 

Finally i get a text:
"We're here - where are you?"  
"Right here," I answered.  
"We don't see you."  
I peered down the platform. <img src="/images/Grand_Central_Flushing_station.jpg">

It was an honest mistake, but one I should have been alert to given what I’d been working on a few days earlier at Metis Data Science Bootcamp. There was a point where our team didn’t yet realize that the variable holding the station name in the MTA Turnstile dataset was similarly confusing.

Like when my friends and I got our wires crossed and ended up waiting for each other at the 42nd St. station, the only problem being that unbeknownst to us, we were two stations apart and seemingly every 7 station in Manhattan seem to have "42nd St" in its name.
