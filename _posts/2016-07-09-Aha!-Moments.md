So far, [Metis data science bootcamp](http://www.thisismetis.com/data-science)'s been as rigorous and satisfying as I thought it would be. Two weeks in and we've had our fair share of <i>Aha!</i> moments. You know, like when you're sitting with your [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) partner, staring at the laptop screen like that's gonna explain how the nested [list comprehension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_comprehension) you cooked up together actually worked, and you're glad you're coding more [Pythonically](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25011078/what-does-pythonic-mean) by the minute, but how is that thing working under the hood and enabling you to save 5 lines of code? One minute it's gobbledygook. And then it isn't. Its logic snaps into rigid focus and you get it. Mind fairly blown.

Apparently I'm not alone:

Raw joy here:

Yes, recursion's as mysterious as anything. Until is isn't:

An inheritance is always nice to get. But getting [*inheritance*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)) can be even sweeter:

Sometimes a discovery plays <b>hide and seek</b>. Like in that dream where you've finally cracked the kidnappers' location and it flashes on your screen for a second and all you have to do is hit <Enter> to transmit it to the SWAT commander and PFFT! your screen dies and your machine spontaneously combusts. Whoops. Let's hope your third grade teacher was right and you really <i>do</i> have a photographic memory. If not, be ready to repent:

Last week, a game of hide and seek really did play out on the Manhattan side of the Flushing !["7"](/images/NYCS-bull-trans-7.svg.png){: .smallpic1} line. I was meeting up with some friends in the *ahem* Grand Central-42nd St. station to ride out to Long Island City to see the Fourth of July fireworks from a friend's envy-enducing 15th floor balcony. Ten minutes after our scheduled meetup time, the text rally began:  
"Where are you?"  
"I'm at the front end of the platform."  
"Us too. We don't see you."  
"I'm right here."  
"Where??"  
"RIGHT HERE!!"  
etc.

Fifteen minutes later, we finally figured out how we'd gotten our wires crossed. I was waiting for them at the Grand Central-42nd St. station while they were waiting for me at the <i>Times Square</i>-42nd St. station. Whoops.

Absurd, given that a week before at Metis, our project team was lamenting the annoying ambiguity of subway station names in the data files we were working with. Only by assigning latitude/longitude values and archaic acronyms could we reliably distinguish these 3 stations:

![](/images/ind_42nd_in_data.png)
![](/images/times_sq_in_data.png)

Learn everything you can from your data. Starting with the very simple lesson that its ambiguities might be less a data collection artifact than a reflection of real-world ambiguity. I have no confidence that there isn't another "42nd St." station in my future that won't match up with someone else's "42nd St." station, where the price for error will be more along the lines of a SWAT team not getting the info they need to save the day.

The fireworks were dazzling, BTW. Spontaneous combustion of the best kind.
