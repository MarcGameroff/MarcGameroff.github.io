So far, [Metis data science bootcamp](http://www.thisismetis.com/data-science) has been as rigorous and challenging as I thought it would be. Satisfying, too. We're two weeks in and I've already had some exciting <i>Aha!</i> moments. You know, like when you're sitting with your pair programming partner, staring dumbly at the laptop screen as if that's gonna explain why the list comprehension you cooked up actually worked, and you're glad you made your code more Pythonic and all but how in the world is that beautiful Python comprehension working under the hood and enabling you to save 5 lines of code and then suddenly the logic and mechanism come into rigid focus in your mind and you've finally understood <b>why</b>! It can be breathtaking. 

Apparently I'm not alone:

Sometimes a discovery will play <b>hide and seek</b>. It's like you've decrypted the kidnappers' location in time to mobilize the SWAT team and rescue an entire family and then you get the [Blue Screen of Death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Screen_of_Death) before you can reliably memorize or transmit the location. Let's hope your doting aunt was right and you really <i>do</i> have a photographic memory after all. If not, be ready to repent:

Last week, a game of hide and seek played out on some Manhattan platforms of the Flushing !["7"](/images/NYCS-bull-trans-7.svg.png){: .smallpic1} line. I was meeting up with some friends in the Grand Central-42nd St. station so we could ride together to Long Island City to see the Fourth of July fireworks from another friend's 15th floor balcony. Ten minutes after our scheduled meetup time, the text rally began:  
"Where are you?"  
"I'm at the front end of the station."  
"Us too. We don't see you."  
"I'm right here."  
"Where???"  
"RIGHT HERE!!"  

Turns out <b>this</b> is what had happened:

We'd gotten our wires crossed: They were waiting for me at the <i>Times Square</i>-42nd St. station and I was waiting for them at the <i>Grand Central</i>-42nd St. station. Ironic--or just plain silly--given that a week before, our Project Benson team was commenting on the annoying ambiguity of station names in some of the data files, to the point where we needed to refer to the latitude and longitude values to ensure we were properly identifying the stations.

Anyhow, we made it to the fireworks with plenty of time to spare, and they were as dazzling and explosive as my next <i>Aha!</i> moment will likely be.
